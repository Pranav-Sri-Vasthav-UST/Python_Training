there are 3 points in the graph
calculate the distance between them
and check weather the points can form a right angle triangle, isoscalus triangle and right angle isoscalus triangle
give me 4 different co-ordinates for each points
so that i can check all the test cases
use a for loop and print all the test cases with proper naming convention
